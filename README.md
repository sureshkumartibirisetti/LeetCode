# LeetCode Problem Solutions

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I have uploaded solutions for various problems from **LeetCode**. This repository serves as a compilation of my solutions across a variety of coding problems that test different aspects of problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms. Each solution is structured for clarity, efficiency, and understanding.

## About This Repository

This repository contains solutions to problems categorized by difficulty level—**Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**—and covers a broad range of topics such as:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Backtracking
- Recursion
- Hash Maps
- Math-related problems

Each problem has been solved with the intention of improving algorithmic thinking and coding efficiency. Solutions are written in **Java**  with clear and concise code that follows best practices.

## How to Use This Repository

You can browse through the different folders categorized by **problem type** or **difficulty level**. Each folder contains:

- The **problem statement**: A link to the original problem on LeetCode.
- **Code solutions**: Fully functional code for the problem.
- **Explanation**: Each solution has comments for easy understanding of the approach and logic used.
- **Time and space complexity**: Annotations to specify the complexity of the solution.

## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode is an excellent platform for honing your coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. With challenges ranging from easy to hard, it's a great way to get better at solving algorithmic problems and gain a deep understanding of core computer science concepts. Through this repository, I aim to showcase my journey of growth and improvement in problem-solving.

## Repository Structure

Here’s a quick glance at how the repository is organized:

```
├── Easy
│   ├── Problem_1_Two_Sum.java
│   ├── Problem_7_Reverse_Integer.java
│   └── ...
├── Medium
│   ├── Problem_2_Add_Two_Numbers.java
│   ├── Problem_19_Remove_Nth_Node_From_End_of_List.java
│   └── ...
├── Hard
│   ├── Problem_23_Merge_k_Sorted_Lists.java
│   ├── Problem_239_Sliding_Window_Maximum.java
│   └── ...
```

Each file contains the code with explanations and complexity analysis.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute to this repository, feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-new-feature`).
5. Create a new pull request.

Any contributions are welcome to enhance or add to the problem solutions!

## Future Enhancements

I plan to add the following features to this repository soon:

- **Test cases** for each problem to ensure correctness of the solution.
- More detailed **explanations** and **approach discussions** for harder problems.
- Solutions in other languages such as **Python**, **C++**, etc.

## Acknowledgments

I’d like to thank the LeetCode community and everyone involved in maintaining the platform for providing such an incredible resource for improving coding skills and preparing for interviews.

Feel free to use and learn from this repository, and I hope it helps you in your own journey of becoming a better coder!

Happy coding!
